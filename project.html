This Project contributes 60% of Total CA Marks.

You should use HTML5, CSS, javascript and jQuery to complete this project.
Submit the completed project folders and documentation files on or before 23
Nov 2019 11:55pm.

Aims and Objectives
-	To gain experience in designing website using HCI knowledge learned.
-	To apply the basics of HTML5, CSS, javascript and jQuery programming.
-	To gain experience in developing User-centered webpages using HTML5, CSS, javascript and jQuery. 

Introduction
This is a group project and should be done in teams of 2 students. On the
project cover sheet you must state the contribution of each member using the
format below: 
	
Student ID	Name		Contribution	Signature
181234567	Chan Tai Man	50%	
187654321	Wong Sui Ming	50%	
* Remark: The difference of contribution should not be more than 10%; otherwise, approval is required.

Scenario

InnoTech HK Inc. tried to provide a new service called “Yummy Everywhere” that
provides an online portal for customers to browse takeaway menus of various
restaurants in Hong Kong.  Therefore, it provides services to two parties,
restaurants and customers.  You are the designer of this online portal.  In
order to develop a user-centered web application, you are going to create a
prototype for the UI first.

Functions of the System:
There are three types of users: normal_user (customer), operator (restaurant) and administrator (InnoTech HK).

1. Restaurant Information Management:
•	Operator 
•	Input information of restaurant (including branches)
•	Update take-away menu 
•	Allow showing/hiding special / temporary / seasonal menu according to the pre-set date or period
•	Hide/remove uploaded menu

2. Search & Browsing:
•	Normal_user
•	Search take-away menu or restaurant by tags or keywords
•	View restaurant information and related take-away menu
•	Add/Remove take-away menu or restaurant to/from favorite
•	Leave like or comment on a particular restaurant
(Public without registered, can only view/search restaurant information, but cannot view the menu.)

3. Account Management:
Normal_user could create an account by self-registration.  While Operator
accounts is created by Administrator manually.
•	Administrator
•	Show existing users
•	Create and delete users
•	Manage the user role
•	Normal_user:
•	Registration
•	Normal_user, Operator and Administrator
•	Edit personal detail including change password

4. Additional Function:
    You are required to design and add the fourth function to the system which
    should be of the similar scope size of the above mentioned functions.


Requirement of the Assignment
You are required to submit System Documentation and Prototype in HTML format as
deliverables of this project. The design of your system should be
self-explanatory and user-friendly.  In your project, try to add animation to
each function so to make them look more interesting and attractive to the
users. Data validation is required wherever necessary.  You are encouraged to
add special features to score bonus mark, for examples: Visualize statistic in
graphical formats, search restaurant information on a map (i.e., google map,
baidu map and etc.).

1. System Documentation
A.	User Analysis
You should carry out the User Analysis process before you start coding your
system. In your document, you should include the following areas of research:
•	User Characteristics
•	Techniques for observing and listening to users
•	Environment Analysis
•	Recruiting Users
•	Task Analysis (HTA)

B.	Web Design Concepts
In the second part of the documentation, you should describe how you employ the
web design concepts learned in the module and then implement them in your
project.  In the document, you need to capture relevant screen layouts for
illustration. You should describe the Design Principles similar to the
following table:

Design Principles	Description
Mental Model	
Affordance	
Content Organization	
Visual Organization	
Navigation	

2. Prototype
The Prototype should be created in HTML format.  All the pre-created user name
and password should be listed in a text file named “USERS.TXT”.  Database
design/implementation will not be counted in the marking scheme. You may use
JSON files or “hardcode” some data for demonstration purpose.

Submission

Each group should submit the followings:

Phase 1 : Prototypes of the 1st and 2nd Functions (30%)
-	Prototype of the system which include function 1 and function 2.
-	 Upload your files to Moodle.
Deadline:      19 October 2019 11:55pm


Phase 2 : Final Product (70%)
-	Both system documentation and completed system.
-	Upload your files (both the prototypes and system documentation) to Moodle.
-	Demonstration of the system is required and will be arranged by the module lecturer.

Deadline:      23 November 2019 11:55pm



Marking Scheme

They are described in the Project marksheet in the next page.

Marks for enhancement of the prototypes of the 1st and 2nd functions submitted
in Phase 2 will be given only if the group has significant enhancement in those
functions when comparing with that submitted in Phase 1. Besides, the maximum
mark for that is limited to 15% (5% for the 1st Function and 10% for the 2nd
Function) only.  Besides, the overall marks of the Phase 1 must not be more
than 30%.

Functionality includes the accuracy and adequacy of the functions. Data validation is also included.

System design includes the flow of the system, self-explanatory and user-friendliness.
